                <p>The game of Flat Track Roller Derby is played on a flat, oval track.
                Play is broken up into two 30-minute periods, and within those periods, into units of play called “Jams,” which last up to two minutes.
                There are 30 seconds between each Jam.</p>
                <p>During a Jam, each team fields up to five Skaters.
                Four of these Skaters are called “Blockers” (together, the Blockers are called the “Pack”), and one is called a “Jammer.”
                The Jammer wears a helmet cover with a star on it.</p>
                <p>The two Jammers start each Jam behind the Pack, and score a point for every opposing Blocker they lap, each lap.
                Because they start behind the Pack, they must get through the Pack, then all the way around the track to be eligible to score points on opposing Blockers.</p>
                <p>Roller derby is a full-contact sport; however, Skaters cannot use their heads, elbows, forearms, hands, knees, lower legs, or feet to make contact to opponents.
                Skaters cannot make contact to opponents’ heads, backs, knees, lower legs, or feet.</p>
                <p>Play that is unsafe or illegal may result in a Skater being assessed a penalty, which is served by sitting in the Penalty Box for 30 seconds of Jam time.</p>
                <p>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
                <p>A common Jam might go like this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blockers line up behind the Pivot Line and in front of the Jammer Line.</li>
                    <li>Jammers line up behind the Jammer Line.</li>
                    <li>At the Jam-Starting Whistle, the Blockers skate forward and compete for superior position.
                    The Jammers skate forward and try to get through the Pack.
                    Each Blocker simultaneously tries to prevent the opposing Jammer from getting past, and to help their own Jammer get through.</li>
                    <li>One Jammer exits the Pack and is declared Lead Jammer, earning the right to end the Jam when they decide.
                    This Jammer races around the track to get into scoring position.</li>
                    <li>The same Jammer begins to work their way through the Pack for the second time, and the opposing Jammer makes their way out of the Pack for the first time.</li>
                    <li>As the second Jammer to escape the Pack comes around into scoring position, the first Jammer calls off the Jam.</li>
                    <li>The first Jammer has scored points (up to four), and held their opponent at zero points.
                    Meanwhile, the opposing Jammer (by getting into scoring position) held the first Jammer at only those points, as they could have scored more points on subsequent passes.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p><strong>A game lasts for 60 minutes of play, divided into two 30-minute periods with a halftime between them.</strong>
                    Periods are broken into Jams, which are the basic unit of play for roller derby.</p>
                    <p><strong>A Jam can last up to two minutes.</strong>
                    Jams may be called off prior to two minutes as part of gameplay, as described below.
                    Each Jam starts with a single short whistle blast, and finishes at the end of a series of four short whistle blasts.
                    At least 30 seconds must elapse between Jams.
                    More than 30 seconds may not elapse unless a timeout is called.</p>
                    <p><strong>A period starts on the Jam-Starting Whistle of the first Jam for that period.</strong>
                    The period clock does not stop between Jams unless a timeout is called.
                    If the period clock reaches zero before the next Jam has started, the period ends at that moment; otherwise, the period ends at the conclusion of the final Jam for the period.</p>
                    <p>If a Jam is called off due to officiating discretion (<em>see Section 5.2</em>) or there is an officiating error that potentially impacted the outcome (<i>as in winner/loser</i>) of the game, and there are less than 30 seconds remaining on the period clock at the end of the game (<i>including when the period clock has expired</i>), an additional Jam may be run at the discretion of the Head Referee. This additional Jam will have the same form (<em>Overtime or not; see Section 1.5.1</em>) as the Jam that ended and be part of the same period.</p>

                    <p><strong>A team is comprised of Skaters, who must be uniquely identified by a roster number.</strong>
                    Each team must have a jersey of the same base color, such that uniform colors of the two teams playing are of high contrast.
                    Roster numbers must be clearly displayed on a Skater’s back and upper arm areas.
                    Each team must have helmet covers to clearly indicate who their Jammer and Pivot are.
                    The Jammer and Pivot helmet covers for the two teams must be easy to differentiate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Skaters must wear quad-style roller skates and protective gear during play.</strong>
                    Inline skates are not permitted.
                    Protective gear may not be removed during play.
                    Protective gear may not impair or interfere with the safety or play of other Skaters, support staff, or Officials.</p>
                    <p><strong>Skaters who are injured during play may return to play as long as they are no longer apparently injured or bleeding.</strong>
                    A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game (<i>examples include a Jam being called off, a period clock stoppage, or a substitute being seated in the Penalty Box</i>) may not participate during the following three Jams (<i>extending into the following period if necessary</i>).
                    A Skater whose injury alters the flow of the game more than once in a period may not participate as a Skater for the rest of that period.
                    The Head Referee <strong>may</strong> also declare that a team has forfeited the game if that team has five or fewer Skaters eligible to participate, or refuses to field Skaters on the track to continue play.</p>

                    <p><strong>Teams and Officials may stop the period clock by calling a timeout.</strong>
                    Timeouts may only be called between Jams, though Officials may end a Jam in order to call an Official Timeout.
                    The beginning of a timeout is marked by four short whistle blasts, and the end of a timeout is marked by a long rolling whistle, after which the next Jam begins as soon as possible if there is time remaining on the period clock.
                    At most, 30 seconds may pass before the next Jam begins.
                    The period clock starts again at the Jam-Starting Whistle.</p>
                    <p>There are three types of timeouts.</p>

                            Team Timeouts may be requested only by the team’s Captain or Designated Alternate.
                            Penalized Captains or Designated Alternates cannot request a Team Timeout.
                            Team Timeouts last for 60 seconds.</p>

                        <article>
                            <p><strong>Each team begins the period with one Official Review</strong> which they may use during that period.
                            An Official Review is a formal request made by a team’s Captain or Designated Alternate for Officials to review a specific officiating decision.
                            The only officiating decisions that can be the subject of an Official Review are those made during the prior Jam, or during the lineup time preceding the prior Jam.
                            The Head Referee investigates the review with other Officials, and uses the information gathered to render a decision on the item under review, as well as related decisions.
                            The Head Referee then announces their findings and any changes that result from the review to both teams’ representatives.
                            This decision is final and not reviewable.</p>
                            <p>If the Head Referee determines that an officiating error was made in relation to the situation under review, the team will retain the privilege to call an additional review later in the same period.
                            The review can be retained in this manner only once per period.</p>
                            <p>A team may also elect to use their Official Review as a Team Timeout.
                            In this case, the review will not be retained.
                            Penalized Captains or Designated Alternates cannot request an Official Review.</p>
                            <p>Official Reviews (<i>whether unused or retained</i>) are not carried forward to the subsequent period.</p>

                                <p><strong>Officials may take a timeout in order to ensure that the game is running smoothly and correctly.</strong>
                                If the prior Jam ended with less than 30 seconds on the period clock, the fact that the Officials called a timeout will not necessarily result in another Jam occurring in the same manner that a Team Timeout or Official Review would.
                                Instead, the Officials must determine whether or not there is reason to hold another Jam for that period.
                                If the Officials determine that there is no reason to hold another Jam, both teams must be given a chance to call a Team Timeout or Official Review (<i>if they have any remaining</i>).
                                If they decline, the period will end.</p>

                        <p><strong>The track must conform to the standardized dimensions of the WFTDA Track Specifications.</strong>
                        The track must be flat, clean, and suitable for roller skating.
                        The track must be marked by a boundary that stands in high contrast to the floor.
                        The boundary counts as part of the track (<i>the boundary is “in bounds”</i>) and may not vary in width around the track.</p>
                        <p>The track boundary, the Pivot Line, and the Jammer Line may be of any pattern or color so long as they clearly mark the edge of the track.</p>
                        <p>Near the track, an area must be marked out for each team (<i>the Team Bench Area</i>) and for the Penalty Box.
                        The boundary in these cases must also be high contrast and counts as part of the relevant area.
                        For example, the boundary for the Penalty Box counts as part of the Penalty Box.
                        Only Skaters who are actively serving a penalty may enter the Penalty Box Area.</p>

                        <p><strong>For each Jam, a team must field one Jammer, and at most four Blockers.</strong>
                        One of these Blockers may be designated as the Pivot Blocker.
                        Any Skaters who are not completely on the track at the Jam-Starting Whistle may not participate in the Jam, and thus do not count toward these limits.
                        Skaters serving penalties (<i>in, or on their way to, the Penalty Box</i>) are counted toward these limits.
                        Teams must field at least one Blocker who is not serving a penalty.
                        Skaters may not change positions during a Jam, except in the case of a Star Pass (<i>see below</i>).</p>
                        <p>When a Jam begins, the Jammers must be touching on or behind the Jammer Line.
                        All Blockers must be behind the Pivot Line, ahead of the Jammer Line, and all Non-Pivot Blockers must not be touching the Pivot Line.
                        If either Pivot is positioned touching the Pivot Line at the Jam’s start, all Non-Pivot Blockers must be behind that Pivot’s hips.</p>
                        <p>Any Skaters who are completely on the track, but partially illegally positioned (<i>for example, a Jammer who is touching past the Jammer Line</i>) are required to yield their position to all other Skaters in the immediate vicinity.
                        Any Skaters who are wholly illegally positioned are immediately penalized.
                        Blockers who are required to yield are not considered for Pack definition until they have done so. Jammers who are required to yield cannot earn passes until they have done so.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Jammer is denoted as the Skater in visible possession of the Jammer helmet cover (<i>a.k.a. the Star</i>) at the beginning of the Jam.</strong>
                                If a Skater is serving a penalty as their team’s Jammer, no teammate may begin the Jam in possession of the Star or behind the Jammer Line.
                                If there is neither a Skater serving a penalty as the Jammer nor a Skater with a visible Star, then the team has failed to field a Jammer for the upcoming Jam and will be penalized accordingly.
                                Unless they are serving a penalty, the Jammer must start the Jam on or behind the Jammer Line.
                                Jammers may be stopped or coasting, but may not be actively gaining speed in the counterclockwise direction at the Jam-Starting Whistle.</p>
                                <p>The Star may only be carried by the Jammer wearing it on their helmet, or by that team’s Jammer or Pivot holding it in their grasp.
                                Other Skaters may not control the Star, and the Jammer and Pivot may not hide the Star (<i>examples include putting it in a pocket or hiding it in a uniform</i>).</p>
                                <p><strong>The Jammer is the only Skater who can score points for their team</strong> (<em>see Section 3</em>).</p>
                                <p>Jammers may also legally exit and remain outside of the Engagement Zone.</p>

                                        <p><strong>A team’s Jammer may transfer their position to their team’s Pivot by successfully completing a legal Star Pass.
                                        A legal Star Pass requires the Jammer to hand the Star to their team’s Pivot while both Skaters are upright, in bounds, and in play; and while neither Skater is en route to, or in queue for, the Penalty Box.</strong>
                                        Upon releasing the Star into the Pivot’s grasp, the position of Jammer is transferred to the Pivot.
                                        The new Jammer takes over for the previous Jammer in terms of points scored, trips through the Pack, and Skaters passed.
                                        The previous Jammer becomes a Non-Pivot Blocker.</p>
                                        <p>If the Star is passed illegally, both Skaters retain their existing positions.
                                        This includes:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Releasing the Star into the grasp of a Skater other than their Pivot</li>
                                            <li>Releasing the Star into the Pivot’s grasp while either of the two Skaters is down, out of bounds, out of play, or en route to the Penalty Box</li>
                                            <li>Releasing the Star into the Pivot’s grasp while the Pivot is in queue for the Penalty Box (<i>even if the Pivot is not yet en route</i>)</li>
                                            <li>Releasing the Star into the grasp of a Pivot who is not wearing the Stripe</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>If the Pivot comes into control of the Star through an unsuccessful Star Pass or any other means (<i>for example, by picking up a Star that has fallen to the ground</i>), they will be warned that they are not the Jammer.
                                        Accordingly, the Pivot may not put the Star on their own helmet, but they may hold the Star in their hand, drop it, or return it to the Jammer.
                                        Only the Jammer or Pivot may recover or control the Star.</p>
                                        <p>The initiator of an illegal Star Pass (<i>or Star recovery</i>) that impacts the game should be penalized.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Lead Jammer is the first Jammer who establishes a superior position to the foremost in-play Blocker, having already earned a pass on all Blockers excluding those ahead of the Engagement Zone</strong> (<em>see <a href="#passing" rel="internal">Section 2.5</a></em>).
                                When one Jammer is determined to be the Lead Jammer, this is indicated by two short whistle blasts.
                                A Jammer becomes ineligible to earn Lead during a Jam if they commit a penalty during that Jam, exit the front of the Engagement Zone without having earned Lead, remove their helmet cover, or have their helmet cover removed by a teammate.
                                If both Jammers qualify for Lead at the same moment (<i>for example, the foremost Blocker goes out of play</i>), the foremost Jammer at that moment will be declared Lead.
                                Only Skaters who begin the Jam as Jammers may become Lead (<i>so a Pivot who receives the Star cannot become Lead</i>).</p>
                                <p>The Lead Jammer will lose their Lead Jammer status if they commit a penalty, intentionally remove the Star once it is on, or have the Star intentionally removed from their head by a teammate.</p>
                                <p><strong>The Lead Jammer is the only Skater who may call off a Jam before the full two minutes elapse.</strong>
                                The Lead Jammer calls off the Jam by repeatedly placing their hands on their hips.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Pivot is a Blocker, and is denoted as the Skater in possession of the Pivot helmet cover (a.k.a. the Stripe) at the Jam-Starting Whistle.</strong>
                                The Pivot wearing the Stripe with the stripe showing has several additional abilities that other Blockers do not.</p>

                                    <li>The Pivot may control the Star (pick it up, move it, etc.) even if they are not the Jammer; for example, to recover it and return it to the Jammer.</li>
                                    <li>The Pivot may begin a Jam while touching the Pivot Line.</li>

                        <p><strong>The Pack is the largest group of in bounds and upright Blockers in proximity and containing members from both teams.</strong>
                        If no single group of Blockers meets this definition, there is no Pack, even if there are multiple groups of the same size.
                        Proximity is defined as not more than 10 ft (3.05m), as measured from the hips, in front of or behind the nearest Pack Skater.
                        When a Skater is penalized, they are considered to no longer be on the track for the purposes of Pack definition and relative position determinations.</p>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of all Blockers to maintain a Pack, and intentionally destroying the Pack is illegal.
                        When the Pack is moving counterclockwise or stopped during a Jam, clockwise skating which destroys the Pack is illegal.
                        All Blockers from both teams must act to reform a Pack.
                        For Skaters in the rear group, this includes stepping or skating in the counterclockwise direction.
                        For Skaters in the front group, this includes coasting, braking, or coming to a complete stop.
                        If an immediate action is not sufficient to reform the Pack, additional effort is required.
                        If a Blocker is in the rear group, they must accelerate (until sprinting) toward the front group until a Pack is reformed (<i>coasting, stepping slowly, or stepping in an only somewhat-counterclockwise direction are insufficient</i>), but they may slow in order to avoid unsafe contact when the Pack reformation is imminent.
                        If a Blocker is in the front group, they must actively brake until they come to a complete stop (<i>coasting is insufficient</i>), but they are not required to skate clockwise.</p>
                        <p>Blocks on or by Blockers which have impact while there is no Pack should be immediately penalized.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Engagement Zone is the area in which it is legal for Blockers to engage or be engaged.</strong>
                        The Engagement Zone extends forward and backward 20 ft (6.10m) from the foremost and rearmost Pack Skaters, respectively.
                        Any Blocker outside of the Engagement Zone is out of play and cannot engage or be engaged.
                        Blockers who are outside of the Engagement Zone will be warned, and will be penalized if they do not immediately attempt to return to the Engagement Zone.
                        Blockers ahead of the Engagement Zone are only compelled to skate clockwise to return to the Engagement Zone if the Pack is stopped or moving clockwise.
                        Skaters who are illegally blocked while out of play may legally counter-block.</p>
                        <p>Distances for determining the Pack and the Engagement Zone are measured as the shortest distance, parallel to the inside track boundary, between Skaters’ hips.</p>

                        <p><strong>“Blocking” refers to any physical contact made to an opponent, and to any movement or placement of one’s body to impede said opponent’s speed or movement, during a Jam, whether or not contact is made.</strong>
                        Counter-blocking is any movement towards an oncoming block by the receiving Skater.
                        Counter-blocking is blocking.
                        Actions that meet the above description are considered blocking, even if accidental.
                        Contact made to teammates is not considered blocking even if it is a disadvantage to the initiator or teammate.</p>
                        <p>All contact between opponents has an initiator, though it is possible for two or more Skaters to mutually initiate blocks against one another.</p>
                        <p>Skaters may not block or assist while out of bounds, out of play, down, stopped, or moving clockwise.
                        Skaters also may not initiate a block on an opponent who is down, out of play, or fully out of bounds.
                        Skaters may, however, initiate a block (or assist) on someone who is straddling, stopped, or moving in any direction (even clockwise).
                        Skaters may not assist a teammate who is out of play or fully out of bounds; however, they may assist a downed teammate to return them to an upright position.</p>

                        <p><strong>Skaters gain superior position on other Skaters by passing them in the counterclockwise direction.</strong></p>
                        <p>Passing another Skater refers to moving such that one Skater’s center of mass (as demarcated by their hips) moves from behind another Skater’s center of mass to ahead of it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jammers only “earn” a pass if the pass occurs while the Jammer is wearing the Star on their helmet with the stars showing.</strong>
                        All earned passes count as passes.
                        Passes are only “earned” if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Jammer is upright and in-bounds during the pass, or</li>
                            <li>Another Skater skates behind the in-bounds Jammer, giving up their position</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As soon as a Jammer earns a pass on an opposing Blocker, they also earn a pass on any opponents who are “not on the track”–meaning that they are not part of active gameplay for some reason–and who cease to be part of active gameplay prior to the completion of the Jammer’s scoring trip.
                        This includes a Skater who:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is sent to or serving time in the Penalty Box</li>
                            <li>Leaves the track due to injury</li>
                            <li>Leaves the track temporarily to fix equipment or skates</li>
                            <li>Was not part of the Jam in the first place (because their team did not field the maximum number of Skaters)</li>
                            <li>Returns to active gameplay behind the Jammer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Skater who passes someone while airborne is considered to be “in bounds” if they are in bounds when they leave the ground and the first contact they make upon landing is in bounds.
                        A Skater who passes someone while airborne is considered to be “upright” if the Skater is upright when they leave the ground, and if the first contact they make upon landing is with their skate to the track.</p>
